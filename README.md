Takes in input from an inputfile, that includes Students with different grades and different majors(Computer Science, Theater, and Biology only.

Once it takes in all of the students the program sorts them into their respective majors and calculates their grade averages.

Practice with derived classes, and managing an array of Objects.

StudentList (class) - Meant to manage List of students (add students by reading them in from the input file) and display all of the taken in students.
Student (base class) - Base class which serves as a template for the derived classes (Biology, Theater, Computer Science)
 -Biology (derived) - Category as well as class where final grade, grade average, and final exam are gathered for each Biology Student
 -Theater (derived) - Category as well as class where final grade, grade average, and final exam are gathered for each Theater Student
 -Computer Science (derived) - Category as well as class where final grade, grade average, and final exam are gathered for each CompSci Student
